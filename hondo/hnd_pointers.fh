c
c Pointers needed for dynamical allocation of memory in various
c hondo routines. All pointers are based on max L, as that is the
c amount of memory that has been allocated already
c
c We calculate them beforehand, so that we only have to do it 
c once for all the calls to these routines (instead of trying
c to calculate pointers for every call to the routine).

c                           Pointers are in this order !

c           hnd_sd_ij.F     
c                           Each of the four routines will use a 
c                           subset of the pointers, described below:

c
c Each of the five routines will use a subset of the pointers. Blocks
c for each pointer are setup using blocks of hnd_giaoh11, as these are
c the largest blocks. hnd_giaotv10 needs one extra block (which will
c be block 12), which lies half way one of the other (L+2)(L+3) blocks.
